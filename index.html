  <h1>Training for the Ironman</h1>
  <p>This is a training guide to the Ironman Triathlon Races<p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="http://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IRONMAN-logo.png">
</div>
<p>An Ironman Triathlon is one of a series of long-distance triathlon races organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run, raced in that order and without a break. It is widely considered one of the most difficult one-day sporting events in the world.[1][2][3]</p>

  <p>Most Ironman events have a strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race. The race typically starts at 7:00 a.m.; the mandatory swim cut off for the 2.4-mile (3.9 km) swim is 9:20 a.m. (2 hours 20 minutes), the mandatory bike cut off time is 5:30 p.m. (8 hours 10 minutes), and the mandatory marathon cut off is midnight (6 hours 30 minutes). Any participant who manages to complete the triathlon within these timings becomes an ironman.</p>

  <p>The name "Ironman Triathlon" is also associated with the original Ironman triathlon which is now the Ironman World Championship. Held in Kailua-Kona, the world championship has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978 (with an additional race in 1982) and is preceded by a series of qualifying Ironman events. Ironman World Championships has become known for its grueling length, harsh race conditions, and Emmy Award-winning television coverage.[4][5]</p>

  <p>Other races exist that are of the same distance as an Ironman triathlon but are not produced, owned, or licensed by the World Triathlon Corporation. Such races include The Challenge Family series' Challenge Roth[6] or the Norseman Triathlon.</p>

<div class="swim">
  <h2>The Swim</h2>
  <p>You can't win the Ironman in the swim, but you can certainly lose it.</p>

  <p>Open water swimming takes place in outdoor bodies of water such as open oceans.</p>

  <p>The beginning of the modern age of open water swimming is sometimes taken to be May 3, 1810, when Lord Byron swam several miles to cross the Hellespont (now known as the Dardanelles) from Europe to Asia.[1]</p>

  <p>In the first edition of the modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, the swimming competition was held in open water. In 2000, the Olympic Games first included a triathlon with a 1500 m swim leg, and in 2008, a 10 km open water swim. 5, 10, and 25 km open water races are included in the General Fina World Championships.</p>

  <p>The activity has grown in popularity in recent years with the publication of bestselling books on "wild swimming" by authors such as Kate Rew and Daniel Start, and the influential Waterlog by Roger Deakin.[2] Further developments have taken place with the National Open Water Coaching Association with Rick Kiddle, Martin Alan and Robert Hamilton focusing on the safety, coaching development of open water swimming and advisory body to clubs, Governing Bodies.</p>

<div class="bike">
  <h2>The Bike</h2>
  <p>Probably the funnest part of the race, but prone to mechanical problems</p>

  <p>Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, or for sport.[1] Persons engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[2] "bikers",[3] or less commonly, as "bicyclists".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).</p>

  <p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number about one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.</p>

  <p>Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances. Bicycles provide numerous benefits by comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise necessarily involved in cycling, that cycling involves a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, much reduced traffic congestion, easier parking, greater maneuverability, and access to both roads and paths. The advantages also include reduced financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).[8] By fitting bicycle racks on the front of busses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[9]</p>

  <p>Among the disadvantages of cycling are the inherent instability of the bicycle, the immensely reduced protection in crashes (especially in collisions with motor vehicles),[10] longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.</p>

<div class="run">
  <h2>The Run</h2>
  <p>Death.</p>

  <p>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions[1]). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.[2] A characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.[3] The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.</p>

  <p>It is assumed that the ancestors of mankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals.[4] Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland in 1829 BCE,[5] while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.[6]</p>
